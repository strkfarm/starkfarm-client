## Getting Started

To run the project locally and start using Starkfarm Client, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository:

**Note: If you already forked, first sync your dev to this repo's dev. This is to ensure, the commit history is exactly same. We often use squash and merge, so if u start with ur old history, unnecessary commits may creep in.**

2. Clone your repo and Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starkfarm-client.git
```

```bash
cd starkfarm-client
```

3. Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

5. Make sure to lint and format your code before creating a PR

- `npm run lint:check` to check for lint errors
- `npm run lint:fix` to fix lint errors
- `npm run format:check` to format the code
- `npm run format:fix` to fix the formatting
- If the code is not formatted properly, the CI will fail
